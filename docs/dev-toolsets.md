---

### 📦 Container Registry & Repository Management

#### Harbor
- **Uses**:
  - Private container registry
  - Storing and managing Docker images and helm artefacts
  - Image security scanning and vulnerability management
  - Management of workload packages as per MARGO defined specification
  - Nextcloud, Nginx and Custom OTEL workload packages are  uploaded to Harbor while environment setup. These [Margo Packages](../poc/tests/artefacts) are based on MARGO application description specification 
  - API-based repository creation and management

---

### 📈 Observability & Monitoring Stack

#### Prometheus
- **Uses**:
  - Metrics collection and storage
  - Scraping OTEL Collector metrics
  - Time-series database for monitoring

#### Grafana
- **Uses**:
  - Metrics visualization and dashboards
  - Data source integration with Prometheus and Loki

#### Jaeger
- **Uses**:
  - Distributed tracing
  - OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) support
  - Performance monitoring and debugging

#### Loki
- **Uses**:
  - Log aggregation and storage
  - Centralized logging solution
  - Receives logs via Promtail

#### OTEL Collector (OpenTelemetry)
- **Uses**:
  - Telemetry data collection (metrics, traces)
  - Data processing and forwarding
  - Integration with observability backends

#### Promtail
- **Uses**:
  - Log shipping agent
  - Pushing logs from Kubernetes pods to Loki

---

### 🔐 Security & Authentication


#### OpenSSL
- **Uses**:
  - TLS certificate generation (RSA and ECDSA)
  - CA certificate creation
  - Server certificate signing
  - Device certificate generation

---

### 🧰 Build & Development Utilities

#### Git
- **Uses**:
  - Source code version control
  - Repository cloning and branch management
  - Integration with GitHub private repositories

#### npm
- **Uses**:
  - Building Symphony UI components
  - JavaScript dependency management
  
  **Note: Symphony UI is not used. Application, deployment and workload LCM operations are performed using the script /pipeline/wfm-cli.sh which we call it as EasyCLI implemented as a wrapper on top of Maestro CLI**

#### curl & wget
- **Uses**:
  - HTTP requests and API testing
  - Downloading installation packages
  - Service health checks

#### jq
- **Uses**:
  - JSON parsing and manipulation
  - API response processing

---

### 🖥 System Utilities

#### dos2unix
- **Uses**:
  - Converting line endings for cross-platform compatibility

#### build-essential, gcc, libc6-dev
- **Uses**:
  - Compilation toolchain for building native applications
  - C/C++ development dependencies

---

### 📦 Workload Packages

#### Nextcloud
- **Uses**:
  - File sharing and collaboration platform
  - Test application for deployment scenarios


---

### 📡 Custom OTEL Application
- **Uses**:
  - Custom telemetry application.
  - Test application for deploying a custom application with telemetry capabilities.
  - This is a sample online ordering application written in GO language which sends metrics and traces to OpenTelemetry collector. This application is defined as MARGO-specified application package and deployed as a workload on device along with the collector. The MARGO package and application source code is available at [Custom OTEL](../poc/tests/artefacts/custom-otel-helm-app)
