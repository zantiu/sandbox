# Non standard implementations of different interfaces

This directory contains **non standardized implementations** that are:

- **Not defined in any official specification**
- **Concrete implementations** that actually work

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Non-standard code** - not part of official specs
- **Custom implementations** - may not be compatible with other vendors
- **PoC-specific** - designed to make this demonstration work
- **Use with caution** - understand this is custom code

## Contents

- Custom interfaces not defined elsewhere
- Concrete implementations for PoC functionality
- Vendor-specific extensions and handlers
- Integration code for non-standard features

## Purpose

This code enables the PoC to demonstrate complete functionality by providing implementations for undefined or missing specifications.
